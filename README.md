## Current features:
- APK decompiling (de-odexing, unpacking resources etc), powered by [ApkTool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool)
- APK re-compiling and signing (currently only test signing is supported)
- Basic APK information (like icon, package name, package version etc), powered by [PyAxmlParser](https://github.com/appknox/pyaxmlparser)
- Plugins support (WIP: Cocos2D plugin which is gonna be capable of packing and unpacking jsc/jsc2/luac files used by this engine)
- User-friendly UI powered by Tkinter!

## Notes:
This project was made by me, and my python knowledge kinda sucks <br>
Don't expect to see quality code here (PR's are welcomed!) <br>
I'm working on this project at spare time, which means that no regular support of this tool will be provided
